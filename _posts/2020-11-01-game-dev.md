Some details here.

This is a sample of something you will write, describing your progress. 

This is a sample of how to include an image in the text if you want: 
<p><img src="/imgs/dog.jpg"><p>
  
Above, in this file, I have included some ways for you to easily share content, like using names of files you upload to the imgs folder or embedding a YouTube video using the ID. Additionally, you will change the title as you continue to write about your progress.

# Big header (h1)
A list 
- item

## Slightly smaller header (h2)
