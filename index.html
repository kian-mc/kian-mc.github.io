    <h3>The e-bike (01/2020 - 08/2020)</h3>
    <p> About a year ago my dad and I started working on and designing an electric bicycle.
       The frame/base of the bike is one we got for free because someone was giving it away. The motor 
        is a 24v brushed DC motor, we used a battery we got from an old scooter that was 37v. The brains
        of the bike is a 36v ESC we got on Amazon along with the throttle from the scooter. At a full
        charge, it can go up to 20 MPH, which classifies it as a class 2 e-bike.

    <h3>e-Bike Repair (10/2020)</h3>
    <p> For a while now, I have been doing some freelance work for a local bike shop. Usually, I
        help them with electronics stuff like soldering wires or diagnosing and repairing electric bicycles
        that customers bring in. This was my first repair job and it went well because of the simplicity of
        the problem. The bike had pedal-assist and the sensor was not correctly orientated on the crankshaft,
        therefore not letting any power go to the motor.</p>

    <h3>Unreal Game Development and Design (10/2020 - Present)</h3>
    <p>Lately, I have been working on a game design project using Unreal Engine. My goal is to create an indie
        game based on the life of my dogs. It will be like an RPG with quests and consequences. Currently, I 
        have been learning the ropes, but I hope to soon start on the actual game.</p>

    <h3>Short Story Project - The Scraplands (10/2020 - Present)</h3>

    <h3>On-Air LED Project (10/2020)</h3>
    <p>Because of all the bad stuff happening in 2020, most people have been forced to work from home. In my 
        home, one of the people living there has had to use Zoom for meetings and because of the place where 
        she uses Zoom, we sometimes walk in on a meeting. This is a problem because it interrupts the meeting and
        it makes her more stressed and angry. That is why I made an LED system where there are three modes,  
        green, red, and off. If she is in the meeting she can turn the light to red to indicate that she is in
        a meeting and when the meeting is over she can use green or off.</p>

    <h3>Baking Bread (10/2020 - Present)</h3>
    <p>Recently, I have been looking for things to do around the house, so I thought that I should get into baking.
        My first dish that is shown is a recipe that my step-mom made awhile back and I recorded on a piece of
        paper. The recipe has proven its worth by being useful in many items from breadsticks to bread. The next
        dish is a cinnamon roll recipe that I found online and it is good! Usually, I don't think that my food is
        very good, but this was, which was very surprising.</p>
